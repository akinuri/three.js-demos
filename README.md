# three.js-demos
I have, recently (2020-08), grown an interest in [three.js](https://threejs.org/), but did not came accross any simple, gradual examples. Almost every (beginner) example do the same thing: [create an unilluminated cube](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene). What do I do next? That cube (alone) doesn't really inspire me!

So I decided to create simple (self-explanatory) scenes and store/share them, as I figure things out,  in hopes they'll be useful for others.
